pinterest gfx downloadr written in Python.

On pinterest.com users organize their images in boards (themes if you like).
If you like the images of such a board this scripts helps you to get all the
images onto your disk. This script downloads the closeup images (the big ones).

The only parameter needed is the url of the board e.g.:

    pindownloadr -b http://pinterest.com/<username>/<boardname>/
    pindownloadr -b http://pinterest.com/johnfernandez/outer-limits/

For more options run script with -h or --help.

This script uses libs: progressbar, requests.
Install with pip/easy_install (or use your package manager):
pip install progressbar
pip install requests

If you use Python < 2.7 you may need also argparse:
pip install argparse
