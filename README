If you like the images of such a board this scripts helps you to get all the
images onto your disk. This script downloads the closeup images (the big ones).

The only parameter needed is the url of the board e.g.:

    pindownloadr -b http://pinterest.com/<username>/<boardname>/
    pindownloadr -b http://pinterest.com/johnfernandez/outer-limits/

For more options run script with -h or --help.

pip install progressbar
pip install requests
pip install pyquery

If you use Python < 2.7 you may need also argparse:
