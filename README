pinterest gfx downloadr written in Python.

On pinterest.com users organize their images in boards (themes if you like).
If you like the images of such a board this scripts helps you to get all the
images onto your disk. This script downloads the closeup images (the big ones).

The only parameter needed is the url of the board e.g.:

    pindownloadr -b http://pinterest.com/<username>/<boardname>/
    pindownloadr -b http://pinterest.com/johnfernandez/outer-limits/
    
You can even download secret boards now. Create a file "cookies.txt" in your
working directory. Login with your favourite browser into pinterest.com and
get the cookies for e.g. from a cookie manager or from the developer tools
(chrome) or HTTP live header extenstion (firefox). "cookies.txt" should look
like this (you have to add the values after = of course...):

view=
_pinterest_sess=
_pinterest_email_referral=
memo=
csrftoken=
viewParameter=
viewType=
element=
__utma=
__utmb=
__utmc=
__utmz=
__utmv=
component=

For more options run script with -h or --help.

This script uses some other python libs you need to install:

pip install progressbar
pip install requests
pip install pyquery

If you use Python < 2.7 you may need also argparse:
pip install argparse
